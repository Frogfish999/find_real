find_real minigame for wolverinesoft long term project

This is a minigame for the wolverinesoft long term project. Use this README to list design decisions ect.
(We should probably only edit the "we can change this stuff section individually to make sure we're on the same page)

------------------------------------------------
This is basically finalized:

-Nothing here yet cause we haven't really started 

-------------------------------------------------
We can change this stuff:

-General
--How many balls?
--2D?, 2.5D?
--Incentives to push game along?
--Theme?

-Movement
--Always moving (control direction)?
---Benefits: easier to blend in, easier to code AI
--2 stick shooter?
---Benefits: easiest to control, less frustrating, crowds less chaotic
--1 stick, just attack

-When you successfully kill a human opponent:
--All their decoys change to your color
--No attack animation?
--No recharge time?
--Other incentives?

-Powerups
--Given to one person or to entire game?
--Randomly or picked up?
---Maybe VIP type character walks in, humans can kill to claim Powerups

-Powerup Ideas
--Lights out
--Camo
--Decoys disappear
--Colors randomize
