Success sound: Bubble pop, played when a kill is successfully made and decoys change color
-Should be quick since it will be played many times in a row
Miss sound: sword swing swoosh
-Loud and obvious, used to locate a player 
Fail sound: Scream (panicked crowd, not a death scream) many voices
-For effect, don't go overboard with the scream sound, more like shuffling
Musical cue for player eliminated, revelation sound
-Victorious or whatever you think would work as a successful elimination sound
Music: Mission impossible-y, ambient, subtle
Some sort of victory music cue
-Are we doing the same sound for this over each game?
Crowd sounds: Footsteps, mumbling
-Super subtle and ambient
